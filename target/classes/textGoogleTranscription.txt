I'm going to be spending the next 20 or so minutes talking about software to find a birthday. Supper. Define networking is something we've all heard a lot about we know it's important but none of us know why it's important. It's the new style of it software-defined networking is going to help revolutionize how we go to market for service or Internet working. Well today, I want to explore the many facets of This Acronym SPM. I also want to go in and explain what competitors are aligning with what which of those Bassett and then finally at the end of my presentation. I'm going to take some time and I get a little feedback if some of my experiences and take some of that pivot he's we've done over the last six or eight please so die and at the end I wanted to start with a little brief history of networking starting from the seventies and where we are today. So I'm going to be dealing purely right here. So, you know if y'alldon't have to look at the at the projector here starting in the 70s. We had this type of topology. This is called Mainframe or remote terminal topology. These are not switches. It looks a lot like the network rehab today. These are actually servers. And essentially this is a Mainframe and these are hoes off your mind. And all the communication that can take place here. Is that the host can talk to my friend? That's the most fundamental infant child network that's ever been. So this is literally where it started and the Mainframe could take some of that information and communicate it to other host. But this is not at all because the Mainframe is essential Computing process. So anything that comes in here to have to take time to process it and it indicates the network, so to speak something called micro computer network and it looked a lot like your circulars apology. Bloodview who are diving into networking book. I know you've seen this and you might be like when the heck did this ever be at swim at this Everest standard 1980s again. We're not in switches yet. These are still computers that you have host that are speaking the host point-to-point. Clearly this isn't available at all. Whenever you get to 10 host if you want to go from saying Hey to be you have to hop between 6 or 7 computers or 5 or 4 depending on how large the circle is and so that isn't stable extremely expensive. And again, you're using computational power to pass that information along. So the 90s in local area networks. Okay your star and mess Pieology that we all know and love so well. Why do I bring up the history of not working? Well, it's because nothing has changed since 1990 when it comes to networking. We've been utilizing the same topology using Bridges what they call Family Mail change the name of switches in the only evolution of taken place. If we released more protocols and come out the faster connection so much of what the expensive things we've learned have just been an extension if this apology this is not sustainable with the amount of I see that's coming out nowadays with Mobility devices with cloud computing. So now instead of having server storage networking on site you're going to be hosting us off site and you have to bring all that information in through a network. So now they're not worth going to be inundated and never been inundated before so we came out with or not. We even Academia came out with something called SPM What is sdn? Well, it depends on who you ask sir. And if you go to a company on Juniper or Cisco who has a vested interest in keeping switches like they are they're going to have an answer and I'm going to align those to the different definition of the best. So let's start with a virtual look at what a switch really looks like here. Whenever we came out with this apology that I just showed you in the local area network. We came out with a switch that has two planes. This is real Innovative at the time. So you have a control plane in a forwarding plane. Why are they called playing like what are they in the same switch? Well, this is hardware this exists on an application-specific integrated-circuit or an Asian. So this is hardware small computer CPU. Pushing packets boots which is where all of our protocol set your SNMP 0 SPF the IRS all the things we've heard about. So if you have a switch or router here and a router here to control tonight is what's doing the communication with the other entities in a network to say. Hey, that's the direction. We're going to send it. We've all heard of routing tables Right Round Table sending something called a router information made. It said it's inside the control plane. Once the control plane identifies the direction and speed it wants to take The software communicate to another routing table that sits below it called V forwarding information base. Well, I bring that up because the rib is much slower at executing today because the FED sits on the hardware. So as this this this is extremely expensive because you have a lot of software and have a lot of Hardware sitting in the same machine if you did a network with just three of these switches I'm going to circling is Crowders because we know routers and switches often times. Do a lot of the same thing. You have three fifths. You have three ribs. Okay. Thank you. Also have three command line interface is you also have 3 Security Suite you also have three proprietary you out certified free operating systems is just simply is a scale of what we need. So I took a dive into something called OpenFlow and along with many other vendors we came out with the first definition of SD open. Sdn. What we did with other vendors is were taking out the control plane from that forwarding claim. So now the brain fit on a controller for a dl380 server and it from a central location host all the security the programmability the command line interfaces in addition. To some other really neat features that I'm going to dive into and the 40 level does nothing more than for packets. What have we done here? We have commoditized switching to a inexpensive in scalable level. You off her to open Flow open Flow is nothing more than a open-source protocol that we use to separate those two entities. So often times you're here with open-toe capability. That means that it's simply just had the ability to run OpenFlow and separate those two plants. That's a software-defined networking capable switch. So why would people jump to something like this? I mean is it really ready for this? Weld answers yet people in the old days with when you have your control plan on your phone. Come on in. Okay, you had proprietary software on there. So nowadays customers want to have programmable protocols. They want to make up their own protocols in a way that they can make intelligent packet forwarding through their own network does each network is different if you had it if you wanted to do something specific to your business. You just think we could we would say. Oh, well, we love you value as a customer, but no that's not going to happen in the operating system. So to speak that operates as controller allows you to manage beneath. Does anyone have any questions up until this point of throwing a lot at you? American city running open flood light using the OpenFlow protocol we've separated these two planes and this extreme scalable programmable and it's inexpensive. You're no longer have it a paid Cisco $50,000 for switches that you can now just biphasic Merchant silica and what I mean by that is commoditize this and only have a 6 in it. So what exactly is Cisco in Juniper's answer to our solution well, and remember they obviously haven't invested interest in keeping. Switch is a bit complicated. So they got SDM. Via API API an acronym for application programmable interface and it's just the way for you to run different applications and protocols on the switch. So I says well we're going to take a lot of the same apology for going to have a controller. We're going to have our little switches down here that will communicate with your controller. But instead of it being only a forwarding switch having basic silicon you have forwarding You still have your control plane? And on top of all that you have apis for the sake of writing about going to replicate that over the other two switches but a key Isaac this on all of them all of you guys. If it uses the controller still look server to communicate with the switches, but the program ability that was taking place here the the security and the interesting features are taking place here and a controller Cisco has not simplified the network at all. They just added more to it. This is not any less expensive but to Cisco's credit. It is extremely programmable because now you can program at the switch and at the controller level gym? And cuter credit, you can remove some of the control layer of the switch and added up to the DL 380 or whatever server you're using it is capable to remove some of that intelligence. And in their presentations, they often times will say well we removing the intelligent where where simplifying the network the need an execution evidence showing that there's simply not that is still staying very similar to this apology. They have at 4. And for that reason we just don't see this complication of the network that were being promised through this offering. So again, it's not that expensive it is not simplified because you're still having management at this level and yet management at this level and at the end of the day, it doesn't the benefit of high programmability. So at this point is anyone have any questions between the two comparisons and how is that is that Australian programmable compared to the way we were doing it now instead of routers making a decision for them to switch it. So in the past whenever you run River ospf this router make the decision to send this router to make a decision to send to this router. Do you have to hope the guy behind you right now just forwards it to its default gateway, which in this case is your controller and the controller runs its own flow table something similar to our routing tables that we already know. And so now if you want to get from here to hear you don't have to go to F2 me the next switch get no actually just sent you around. So that's the programmability you get in our solution how Cisco's Dippers slightly is that they're running extremely intelligent apis at this level. So what they're able to do is give you an over architecture program ability, but also the ability to do that complicated forwarding on the superior apis and this. The eyes again application for Grandma, but it's just something that allow us to do complicated go to call forwarding so we lack that in this apology because we pushed everything up a boot mode literally removed it and I'll get to opendaylight now kind of a nice segue which is the operating system that use a big event. Well, this is the advantage they have and in this is why I Cisco's taking the market and sdn. I mean actually Cisco owns the network. So this is a natural progression but open operating system. The problem in limitation open floodlight is you have to use OpenFlow. You can't have open floodlight without OpenFlow the cool thing about it. Is it scalable up to 2,000 switches and go routers and you might be thinking holy you know, how would you ever, Day 2012 for large Enterprise businesses? That's extremely so with s e n b a t i v e something Cisco Juniper opendaylight Opendaylight is a open source. So it doesn't require OpenFlow. And for that reason Cisco bus that because they don't want to come because they want to make sure they're able to charge you $40,000 for top rack switch. So in this environment opendaylight allows you not to have to run OpenFlow, but it's Patty. I only scalable 200 switches now, there are some ways to combine the Network's once you have 200 switches you can then go in and you know with the management options kind of similar to what we do and some of our server options is clustered episode. Still you are limited to that to that switch number. Where did you get to thousands opendaylight Sysco in Juniper both adopted opendaylight. And when Cisco up 65% of the market Jupiter Juniper owns 18% when roughly 80% of your market exhaust is technology it then becomes like an industry-standard. So that's a good as the limitation is. We are you the bid on its own with open club by we invested 40 million dollars and then last year and when we did we kind of knows thank our heels into the ground because we really believe that this is what's going to eat. If you take the percentage that HP owners of the switching Market roughly 13, 14% it significantly less then when you consider where to find over 20% so we are doing better. That's the end. We are top-of-rack switches in couraging Word. The final system be faster than they have.
